Boulder is a content mod that as of now is pretty small. As of now, the content is limited, but was made sure to be at least decent quality and roughly balanced for the tier you can get the items.

Since the first update, the mod now has another early game boss and a hardmode biome that generates in the sky after defeating a mech boss. !WARNING! If there is a building in the far left of the world that you wish to keep, do not use this mod as it WILL overrite anything in that area. If you are uncertain, make a test world and defeat a mech boss in that world to see a preview of how it will generate.
